* Remove logging of connections. That should be done by the live driver,
  and it can be as simple as writing to a logfile rather than the db.
* Delete Versioning.hs?
* Make Thing descriptions optional.
* Allow multiple connections by same user?
* Consider stamping every server message with a datetime.
* Consider offloading all authentication matters to Bouncer, including the
  sending of 'Send Credentials' and 'Bad Credentials' type messages.
* Get rid of Conn.hs.
* Clean up Connection.hs.
* Implement one of the driver modules in Prolog.
* Look into use of mzero for (Nothing, []) in gameloop / respond.
* Strongly typed IDs: ExitID (EID), CharacterID (CID), PlaceID (PID), ThingID (TID), etc.
