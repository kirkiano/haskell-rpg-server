Currently the RPG is little more than a chat server that allows characters to
move from place to place, and to speak, whisper to, and look at each other.
Although other characters cannot hear a whisper, they can see that it is
happening.
Similarly for looks.

More than forty bots (\S\ref{sec:bots-current}) periodically
scrape headlines off various websites and speak them into the RPG\@.

Although the game also features inanimate things, they cannot yet be moved
or taken by characters.

Each character has a ``home'' place associated with it, but currently no use is
made of this feature.

Plans for future game play are discussed below.
