This repository contains the core engine for a multiplayer role-playing game
(RPG).
Its chief purpose is to simulating the mechanics of the game world, including,
eventually, a kind of mechanics of human (and possibly animal) psychology.
It does not determine what characters populate the world or what their goals
may be.
That is up to the players who connect to this engine (see below).

The game is networked and accepts connections by TCP and by websocket.
When this aspect of it is of particular interest, the engine will sometimes be
referred to as ``the server.''
When on the other hand the emphasis is on its function as game loop (see below),
it will typically be referred to as ``the engine.''

A Django backend resides in a separate repository.
It authenticates users, manages the underlying database, and provides a couple
of REST endpoints.
The frontend, residing in a third repository, is implemented in Angular.
It~connects to the Django app via HTTP and to the server via websocket.
There is no plan to create a frontend app for the Android or iOS platforms.
