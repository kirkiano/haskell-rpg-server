%% The atomic values occurring in the game are of course drawn from
%% natural numbers, character strings, and the like. But to type them
%% strongly they are tagged with certain constants, shown in monotype
%% font (\eg, \tg{ThisIsAConstant}).

\tabref{AtomicValues} shows the various sets of atomic values. They
will be used below.

Additional details:
\begin{itemize}
%\item \idset\ is a set of infinitely many distinct
%identifiers. Apart from equality, no ordering or other properties are
%required of it.
\item \descset\ is the set of all character strings.
\item \speechset\ is the set of all character strings.
\item \nameset\ is the set of all character strings each of which:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item is at least 1 and at most 64 characters long,
  \item contains only alphanumeric characters or spaces,
  \item contains no space that is not preceded and followed by an
    alphanumeric character, and
  \item is case-insensitive
  \end{itemize}
\item \dirset\ is defined as:
  \begin{align*}
    \dirset \equiv \{~&
  \tg{Up},
  && \tg{Down}, \\
  & \tg{North},
  && \tg{South},
  && \tg{East},
  && \tg{West}, \\
  & \tg{Northeast},
  && \tg{Northwest},
  && \tg{Southeast},
  && \tg{Southwest}
  ~\}
  \end{align*}
\end{itemize}
