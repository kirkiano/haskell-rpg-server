The following sets define the atomic values occurring in the game.
\begin{itemize}
\item \charidset\ is the set of character IDs. It is tagged by the
  constant \charidtg:
  \[ \charidset = \{ \charidtg \} \times \naturals \]
\item \thingidset\ is the set of thing IDs. It is tagged by the
  constant \thingidtg:
  \[ \thingidset = \{ \thingidtg \} \times \naturals \]
\item \placeidset\ is the set of place IDs. It is tagged by the
  constant \placeidtg:
  \[ \placeidset = \{ \placeidtg \} \times \naturals \]
\item \nameset\ is the set of names, defined as the set of character
  strings that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item are at least 1 and at most 64 characters long,
  \item contain only alphanumeric characters or spaces
  \item precede and follow each space with an alphanumeric character.
  \item are insensitive to case
  \end{itemize}
  \item \dirset, the set of all directions
\item \charnameset\ is the set of allowed character names. It is
  tagged by the constant \charnametg:
  \[ \charnameset = \{ \charnametg \} \times \nameset \]
\item \thingnameset\ is the set of allowed thing names. It is tagged
  by the constant \thingnametg:
  \[ \thingnameset = \{ \thingnametg \} \times \nameset \]
\item \placenameset\ is the set of allowed place names. It is tagged
  by the constant \placenametg:
  \[ \placenameset = \{ \placenametg \} \times \nameset \]
\item \speechset\ is the set of allowed utterances, defined as the set
  of character strings.
