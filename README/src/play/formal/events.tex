The events that a character receives from the game are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item An element of the following set signifies that a character has
  entered a place:
  \[ \enteredevtset \equiv \{ \enteredtg \} \times \charidset \times
  \charnameset \times \exitidset \]
  $(\enteredtg, ci, cn, ei )$ means that character $ci$, named $cn$,
  has just entered through exit $ei$.
\item An element of the following set signifies that a character has
  exited a place:
  \[ \exitedevtset \equiv \{ \exitedtg \} \times \charidset \times
  \exitidset \]
  $(\exitedtg, ci, ei )$ means that character $ci$
  has just exited through exit $ei$.
\end{itemize}
The set of all possible events is the union of the above sets:
\begin{equation}
  \evtset \equiv \enteredevtset ~\disjunion~ \exitedevtset
\end{equation}
