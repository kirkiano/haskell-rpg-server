The events that a character receives from the game are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item An element of the following set signifies that a character has
  joined the game:
  \[ \joinedevtset \equiv \{ \joinedtg \} \times \charidset \times
  \charnameset \]
\item An element of the following set signifies that a character has
  quit the game:
  \[ \disjoinedevtset \equiv \{ \disjoinedtg \} \times \charidset \]
  (The word {\em quit} is reserved for a player request; see \secref{play-formal:requests}.)
\item An element of the following set signifies that a character has
  entered a place:
  \[ \enteredevtset \equiv \{ \enteredtg \} \times \charidset \times
  \charnameset \times \exitidset \]
\item An element of the following set signifies that a character has
  exited a place:
  \[ \exitedevtset \equiv \{ \exitedtg \} \times \charidset \times
  \exitidset \]
\item An element of the following set signifies that a character has
  edited its own description:
  \[ \chareditedevtset \equiv \{ \chareditedtg \} \times \charidset \]
\item An element of the following set signifies that one character has
  looked at another:
  \[ \charlookedevtset \equiv \{ \charlookedtg \} \times \charidset
  \times \charidset \]
\item An element of the following set signifies that one character has
  said something:
  \[ \charsaidevtset \equiv \{ \charsaidtg \} \times \charidset
  \times \speechset \]
\end{itemize}
The set of all possible events is the union of the above sets:
\begin{align}
  \evtset \equiv \joinedevtset
  ~\disjunion~ & \disjoinedevtset
  ~\disjunion~ \exitedevtset
  ~\disjunion~ \enteredevtset
  ~\disjunion~ \chareditedevtset \\ \nonumber
  & ~\disjunion~ \charlookedevtset ~\disjunion~ \charsaidevtset
\end{align}
