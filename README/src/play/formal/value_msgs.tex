The value messages that a player can receive from the game as
responses to his or her requests are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \youarevalset. An element of this set, which is tagged by the
  constant \youaretg, is sent in response to a \whoamireqset\ request:
\[ \youarevalset \equiv \{ \youaretg \} \times \charnameset \]
\item \placevalset. An element of this set, which is tagged by the
  constant \placetg, is sent in response to a
  \whereamireqset\ request:
\[ \placevalset \equiv \{ \placetg \} \times \placenameset \]
\end{itemize}
The set of all possible values is the union of the above sets:
\begin{equation}
  \valset \equiv \youarevalset ~\disjunion~ \placevalset
\end{equation}
