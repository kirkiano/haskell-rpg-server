The spatial setting of the game consists of a collection of {\em
  addresses}. Their individual properties are not of interest here, so
  we introduce ony a set \addressset{} of abstract objects representing
  all possible addresses. And for each state $\sigma \in \Sigma$ we
  define the set
\[ \addressset{\sigma} \subset \addressset{} \]
of addresses that are valid (\ie, present) in~$\sigma$.
