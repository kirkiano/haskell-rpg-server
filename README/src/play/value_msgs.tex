In addition to receiving notifications of events, a character will
receive a {\em value message} for each of its requests for
data, as explained in \secref{play:dynamics}.
\tabref{ValueMessages} shows the various sets of value messages;
their union forms the set of all possible value messages:
\begin{align}
  \valset \equiv \youarevalset
  ~\disjunion~ \placevalset
  ~\disjunion~ \placethingsvalset
  ~\disjunion~ \placecharsvalset
  ~\disjunion~ \thingvalset
  ~\disjunion~ \charvalset
\end{align}
