To distinguish the game's various entities---places, characters,
\etc---each is identified by, and is for all practical purposes
identical to, a unique ID, which is a pair consisting of a type
constant and a natural number. \tabref{ids} shows the sets of IDs.
\input{play/ids_table}
Since these IDs correspond to their respective entities bijectively,
we think of, \eg, \addressset{\sigma} and \addressidset{\sigma} as
being interchangeable. These identifications modify the above
requests, events, value messages, in the straightforward way.
