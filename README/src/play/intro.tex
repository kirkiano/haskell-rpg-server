Currently the RPG is little more than a chat server that allows
characters to move from place to place, and to speak, whisper to, and
look at each other.
When a character whispers something to another, other characters
cannot ``hear'' the whispered words, but they are notified that the
whispering is happening.
Similarly for looks.

More than forty bots (\secref{server-impl:bots}) periodically scrape
headlines off various websites and ``speak'' them into the RPG\@.
Although the game also features inanimate things, they cannot yet be
moved or taken by characters.
Each character has a ``home'' place associated with it, but this
feature is currently unused.

Plans for future game play are discussed in \secref{future}.

The rest of this section consists of an experiment in documentation,
one which we would not attempt in the workplace. We want to see what
good might come out of using basic set theory and denotational
semantics to specify the game formally. Formal specifications are
usually given instead in ordinary language plus such modeling tools as
UML, \etc\ But the language of mathematics is maximally terse,
precise, universal, and independent of whichever programming
languages, frameworks, technologies, serialization schemes, \etc, may
be used to implement the system. Let us see if the effort is worth it.
