An {\em event} is a significant occurrence in the game. How events are
triggered by characters' requests, and which characters get notified
of the events, are explained in \secref{play:dynamics}.
\tabref{Events} shows the various sets of events. Their union forms
the set of all possible events:
\begin{align}
  \evtset \equiv \joinedevtset
  ~\disjunion~ & \disjoinedevtset
  ~\disjunion~ \exitedevtset
  ~\disjunion~ \enteredevtset
  ~\disjunion~ \chareditedevtset \\ \nonumber
  & ~\disjunion~ \lookedcharevtset ~\disjunion~ \lookedthingevtset
  ~\disjunion~ \saidevtset
\end{align}
