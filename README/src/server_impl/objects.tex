Things are instances of type \typ{Thing}, which include a name,
a unique ID,\footnote{Unique only among things.} and possibly a description.
The subtype \typ{Character} represents characters, though at this time there
is almost no difference between instances of the two.
Places are instances of type \typ{Place}, which bears a name,
a unique ID,\footnote{Unique only among places.}
possibly a description, and possibly also an address.
As in real life, an address serves as a tag for a set of places that together
form a larger location.
For example each of the abovementioned scraping bots is currently confined to
a specific address, so that it can move only between the places within that
address.

Currently the game engine does not distinguish between a live player and a
non-player character (NPC).
The words ``player'' and
``character'' will typically be used to denote live players and
NPCs indifferently, but sometimes ``player'' will mean a live player\,;
context should make the meaning clear.
Similarly, ``thing'' will be used to
mean either an inanimate object, an NPC, or a live player.
