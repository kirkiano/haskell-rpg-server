To distinguish the game's various entities---places, characters,
\etc---each is identified by, and is for all practical purposes
identical to, a unique ID, which is a pair consisting of a type
constant and a natural number. \tabref{ids} shows the sets of IDs.
\input{impl/ids_table}
These identifications modify the requests, events, value messages,
\etc, listed in \secref{play} in the straightforward way.
