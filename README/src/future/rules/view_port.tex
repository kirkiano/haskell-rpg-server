The simulation of firing ranges raises the question of whether the central
component of the game app should be a graphical view port, rather than a
chat stream, as is currently the case in the Angular frontend.
The game is committed to written language as the medium of communication,
especially as high-resolution animated graphics, even if quickly
rendered, can sometimes amount to bells and whistles that distract from the
essence of the game.
But here and there it might be nice to have an image to look at, if only one
that depicts the current location.
