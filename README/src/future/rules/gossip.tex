To mimic the less savory aspects of real life, characters should be able to
whisper defamatory gossip about one another.
And as in real life, unfortunately, once character A hears gossip about
character B, A should not try to verify the claims, but rather should change
its nonverbal behavior toward B\@, giving it looks and gestures that
reflect the bad-mouthing (\S\ref{sec:future:rules:nonverbal}).
This change in attitude should be permanent, and once a character hears gossip
about another, it should spread it to others, depending on its severity.

For implementation details see \S\ref{sec:future:impl:gossip}.
