As in many other games, each character should have its own measure of
physical health. As in real life, a player should be infected with a
number of pathogens, many of which (\eg, viruses) are usually
harmless, maybe unless the player's health is already compromised in
some other way. If the disease is not deadly, the game should cure the
character of it after a certain amount of time has elapsed, simulating
the everyday work of the immune system.

Health can be broken down into a set of measures: temperature, heart
rate, blood pressure, rate of breath, \etc\

Infection happens in multiple ways. First, and depending on the
pathogen, there should be a probability of infection whenever a
character is in the presence of an infected character who speaks; the
probability can be made higher for whispers. (There are no current
plans for sexually transmitted diseases.)

Secondly, and again depending on the pathogen, each place should have
a probability that a character who enters it will become
infected. This natural method of infection can be made more realistic
by first giving each place a {\em sanitation rating}. If the place is
dirty then, as in real life, it is more likely to attract pests and
thus have a higher probability of infecting someone there.
