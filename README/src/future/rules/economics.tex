The game engine can incorporate a monetary system and an economy in which
characters trade various goods and services as they try to eke out
an existence.
Drivers can be added representing various professions;
journalism and policing have already been mentioned.
Agriculture is another possibility: fields for planting can be added,
and a driver can fill them with farmers.
The game engine may require characters to eat some kind of food if they are
to maintain their health.

And a character can be required to earn a living, using the wages to
purchase various necessities, including food and weapons.
The ability to do this comfortably can be impaired as part of an enemy's attack
on the character, for example by harming the character's reputation.
