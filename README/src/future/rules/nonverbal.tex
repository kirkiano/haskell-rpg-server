The looks that a character can currently give another are neutral.
Game mechanics should include a host of others that are pregnant with meaning:
smiles, frowns, smirks, glowers, looks of shock, pity, joy,
curiosity, confusion, upset,
\etc\@ As in real life, characters should give each other neutral looks
randomly and at some low frequency.

Similarly there should be gestures of the body, and the game should report
(as events) whether a character's body language is not neutral or natural, \eg,
whether it is stiff with pretense, or slumped with fear, or erect with contempt.
