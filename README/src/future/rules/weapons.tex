Elements of more traditional warfare can be introduced in the form of guns,
\etc\@
A character would be able to acquire a gun and shoot at a target, including
an enemy character.
But whether the shot hits is determined by the character's skill.
The game could require characters to practice at firing
ranges, as a condition for improving the accuracy of their aim.
To mimic real life, when it comes time to fire at an actual enemy target later
on, a probability, computed as a function of the extent of past practice, would
determine whether the shot is successful.
