The drivers' REST APIs, intended for consumption by the game
administrator, can form the backend data sources for an admin app that
the administrator could use to survey the running game,
tuning its parameters and those of the various drivers, responding to
various adminstrative problems, \etc
This would require the game engine to set
up a special dataflow for such administration, sending server messages down
it regardless of place or character.

The admin app could implement a map of the world, showing not just places and
exits, but also the current locations of things and characters.
For DRYness this functionality should be shared with the game app, allowing
characters to see the map and use it.
For the sake of realism, a character should probably not be
allowed to see the locations of other characters, unless of course he
or she has the power of abusive surveillance.

The game app is implemented in Angular, so, to be polyglot, this app could be
implemented in React.
