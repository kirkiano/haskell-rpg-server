Among the possible drivers perhaps the lowest-hanging fruit is one that
handles incoming TCP connections from live players across the Internet.
This would of course remove from the game engine the burden of listening for,
accepting, and authenticating those connections.
Since the work of managing sockets and serialization is logically ``flat,''
it is well-suited to a low-level language without garbage collection or a
heavy runtime.
The most compelling at this time is Rust;
see below for further discussion.
The resulting driver would be small and well focused, concerning itself
only with accepting and authenticating TCP connections from the Internet and
plugging them into the game engine.
The slowdown introduced by this modularization should be insignificant, since
live players anyway take time to think about what moves they want to make.
But should there be a need to speed it up, the TCP connection
between this driver and the game engine could be changed up for a UDS one,
as discussed below.

The change will require that \typ{Request}s within the game engine be somehow
associated not just with an individual character, but also with the driver
driving that character.
