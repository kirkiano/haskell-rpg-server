Consider implementing Haskell classes \co{ToJSONM} and \co{FromJSONM},
which would serialize and deserialize within a monad, the database
monad in particular. This would eliminate the need
for, \eg, \co{PlaceRec}, since all the details of a place could be
gotten directly from \co{PlaceR} within the database monad, just
before serialization.
