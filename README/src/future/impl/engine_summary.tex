In conclusion, if the foregoing considerations are sound, then:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The game engine should stay written in Haskell.
    \item The more biological `react` functionality can be added to it in
    Haskell or by Rust FFI\@.
    \item The more sophisticated AI-like aspects of `react` are most easily
    written in a higher-level language, either Haskell directly in the game
    engine, or Lisp or Python in a separate driver, if that does not
    give rise to spoiling delays.
    \item Rust can still be used for the data server.
    \item Rust can still be used for any other drivers that might be
    suited to low-level languages, such as those that run graph algorithms or
    numerical computations---which indeed could be such parts of AI as machine
    learning and matrix computations.
\end{itemize}
